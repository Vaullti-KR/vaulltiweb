If you disagree with any part of these Payments Terms of Use, please do not list items for sale on Vaullti LLC.\r\nThese Payments Terms of Use are between you and Vaullti LLC, as set forth below. In addition to the General Payments Terms (Part I of these Payments Terms of Use), each Vaullti LLC Payment Entity has Additional Payments Terms (Parts II, III, IV, V and VI of these Payments Terms of Use) that apply to the Payment Services such entity provides. Vaullti LLC and the companies it directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, are referred to as our “Affiliates.” \r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>21. GENERAL PAYMENT TERMS\r\nThis Part I of the Payments Terms of Use applies to all Payment Services you receive from the Vaullti LLC   (also collectively referred to as “we” or “us” in this Part).\r\n About Payments on the Vaullti LLC Services\r\nYou agree to have the Vaullti LLC   receive or execute payments on your behalf in relation to your use of the Vaullti LLC Services, and manage settlement of related payments to you (referred to as “Managed Payments,” “Payment Services,” or similar names).\r\nBuyers may pay for your items using payment methods such as the following, the availability of which may vary:\r\n•\tCertain credit or debit cards (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover),\r\n•\tPayPal,\r\n•\tGoogle Pay,\r\n•\tApple Pay,\r\n•\tDirect debit,\r\n•\tVaullti LLC coupons, gift cards, etc. (if applicable), or\r\n•\tFunds held in a stored value account issued under Vaullti LLC's Balance Terms and Conditions (currently only available to selected sellers residing or established in the United States).\r\n•\tBitcoin\r\n•\tEscrow accounts if needed\r\nWe may modify the scope of payment methods available at our sole discretion.\r\nThe underlying contract for the buyer’s purchase of “items” (which may refer to goods and/or services) from you is directly concluded between you and the buyer.\r\nAfter a Managed Payments transaction occurs, you will receive a notification confirming such payment transaction. We will initiate settlement of proceeds received to your Linked Financial Account (as defined below in Part I, Section 4 “Seller Onboarding”. If a payment is made to you in error, or if you receive funds that you are not otherwise entitled to receive at the time of disbursement, we have the right to recoup such amounts from you.\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>22. Onboarding\r\nIn order to use our services, you must register and accept these Payments Terms of Use. If your onboarding is not immediately confirmed, you will receive notification that you have been approved to receive services once we have reviewed your information.\r\nTo set up and use your Vaullti LLC account for Payments, you must:\r\n•\tLink a financial account, so you may receive settlements of proceeds from Managed Payments to this account (“Linked Financial Account”). If we cannot make direct debits from your Linked Financial Account for Owed Amounts (as defined in Section 9), we require you to keep another payment method on file with us and we may withhold payouts to your Linked Financial Account until you have successfully provided us with such other payment method.\r\n•\tRegardless of any other terms about settlement methods on the Vaullti LLC Services (including vaullti llc payment policies and information available when you create listings, which may continue to display settlement methods that are not currently supported for payments that we manage), disbursements via other settlement methods are not available at this time. You may change your Linked Financial Account at any time. Payouts will be made to your new Linked Financial Account subject to (i) your completion of the Linked Financial Account verification process, and (ii) the completion of our assessment for security and risk. Our assessment typically takes up to two (2) days after your completion of the verification process, or longer if any issues or irregularities arise in which case we will complete our assessment without undue delay. You represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of, or have the lawful right to use, any Linked Financial Account you associate with your Vaullti LLC account.\r\n•\tProvide us with all information which we may require for purposes that include: verifying your identity, complying with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions screening obligations, allowing us to manage settlements of your transaction proceeds, and assessing fraud and risk. If you are an individual, this information may include, without limitation, your full name, address, phone number, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, bank account information, and a form of government-issued identification (e.g., a copy of your identity card or driver’s license). If you are a business, this information may include, without limitation, your full business name, address, phone number, entity type, bank account information, tax identification number, and business number, in addition to details regarding your beneficial owner(s), director(s), officer(s), authorized representative, and/or primary contact, such as name, contact information, nationality, title, and government-issued identification (such as a United States Social Security Number). This may also include SAM registration, and proof of ITAR compliance for government compliance. You understand that we will be unable to settle your proceeds or issue you any tax documents (such as a United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-K) if you do not provide or appropriately update us with accurate contact information and other requested data.\r\n•\tProvide us with all information necessary to authenticate you when you use Managed Payments, which may include validation of your phone number or email. You understand that we may be unable to execute certain transactions or complete certain requests without this information.\r\n•\tTimely maintain the accuracy of the information we have on file, and consent to our periodical updating of such stored information based on information provided by you, your bank, or other payments services providers. You will only provide us information about payment or settlement methods that you are authorized to use. You understand that if you update information such as your country of residency, you may need to repeat some or all of the onboarding steps described above to continue using Payment Services.\r\n•\tComply with all, and not cause a third party to violate any, applicable laws, regulations, rules, and terms and conditions in connection with your use of the Vaullti LLC Services. You understand that some third parties (such as banks, credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card networks, and payments services providers) may have their own terms and conditions for the payment or settlement methods you or buyers choose to use in connection with payments that we manage, such as terms and conditions that relate to the settlement of funds, chargebacks, prohibited items, and overdrafts. Failure to abide by third-party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you, delays in your receipt of funds, or other actions taken by such third parties. You agree that we have no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees, delays, or actions.\r\nYou authorize us and our Affiliates to check information you provide to us, including by verifying the existence of your bank account and obtaining reports from, or comparing your information to, third-party sources. Such third-party sources may include without limitation, banks, credit agencies, data brokers, and other service providers. We reserve the right to close, suspend, or limit your account or rescind your access to Managed Payments in the event we are unable to obtain or verify any of this information. We are not responsible for any losses suffered by you as a result of incomplete or inaccurate information you provide.\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>23. Shipping\r\nWhen you receive notice that a buyer has paid for an item through a Managed Payments transaction, you must then ship or otherwise deliver your item in accordance with the buyer's selection from the preselected shipping options that you made available in your listing. You agree to deliver all items purchased pursuant to the terms of your listing and the user agreement, and perform all other necessary transaction-related actions. It is typical that in larger orders proof prints are produced and used as a means to gauge the production value and material, and that full payment may be submitted to vaullti as a holding entity and fees will be released upon completion when proof of work is shown. \r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>24. Managed Payments Limitations\r\nIn some listings or categories, Vaullti LLC may allow sellers to offer buyers the option to pay for a purchase directly to the seller without using the payment services offered by us under these Payments Terms of Use, for example Invoicing. We do not manage payments for Invoicing. We will not assist buyers or sellers with payment disputes in connection with invoicing. We serve as an intermediary for capital in invoicing situations, as well as a “gatekeeping” measure to ensure quality assurance. Your listings are subject to Vaullti LLC payment policy and any other terms about payments that may appear on the Vaullti LLC Services, including terms relating to the payment and disbursement methods available to you for such listings.\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>25. Using Managed Payments\r\nReturns and Cancellations; Refunds\r\nIf your buyer is entitled to a refund for a return or cancellation for a Managed Payments transaction, based on an agreement between you and the buyer or according to Vaullti LLC’s policies regarding such transaction, you authorize us to pay to the buyer the corresponding refund amount on your behalf.\r\nDisputes\r\nA buyer (or the owner of a payment instrument) may initiate a chargeback, direct debit reversal, or otherwise asks their financial institution to open a payment dispute (all referred to solely within this Part I as “Dispute”) in connection with a transaction. The final outcome of the Dispute will be decided by the buyer’s financial institution.\r\nWe will manage Disputes, as follows: When a Dispute is opened, we will notify you and ask you whether you choose to accept or challenge the Dispute. If you accept the Dispute, you agree to the reversal of the payment to the buyer. If you challenge the Dispute, Vaullti LLC will submit to the financial institution any relevant evidence you provide about the Dispute. You agree to provide timely information to assist in the Dispute resolution process and understand that your failure to provide requested information on the timeline we require and as specified by credit and debit card networks' and other payment service providers' rules could adversely impact the outcome of a Dispute investigation, up to complete forfeiture of the amounts in Dispute. If you accept the Dispute or if the buyer’s financial institution decides in favor of the buyer, the respective amount will be refunded to the buyer's original payment method and charged to us. You must reimburse us for such charges, unless you are eligible for protections in which case you are not held liable for amounts refunded to the buyer. If you choose to accept the Dispute, we may still decide to challenge the Dispute in our discretion and at no additional costs to you.\r\nSome payment institutions offer an optional arbitration process to contest the results of an individual Dispute. We may ask for your consent to participate in such arbitration process. If you consent to chargeback arbitration, you authorize us to represent and defend you throughout the arbitration. You will be responsible for all costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and any arbitration fees assessed by third parties, arising from such arbitration proceedings), as agreed between you and us in each case, and you authorize us to pay these amounts on your behalf while the arbitration is pending.\r\nYou will not contest the resolution of any Dispute that we investigate and/or re-present, nor will you re-open resolved Dispute investigations. \r\nFines, Penalties and Losses\r\nAt this time we are unable to manage payments for prohibited items.  Before listing your item, you must ensure it complies with Vaullti LLC’s rules, applicable laws, and any additional restrictions imposed by credit card associations, network rules, or third-party payments service providers that we may use.\r\nYou agree to indemnify and reimburse us for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, costs, losses, damages, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses incurred by us or brought against us by a third party arising out of (a) your breach of these Payments Terms of Use or the User Agreement including without limitation any violation of Vaullti LLC’s policies; (b) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or (c) any transaction processed by us for you for an item or service you listed on Vaullti LLC (including without limitation the accuracy of your item description or any claim or dispute arising out of items or services offered or sold by you).\r\nHolds\r\nWe reserve the right to manage the risks associated with providing you the Payment Services, by placing restrictions on your access to your funds when deemed necessary, as described in further detail below.\r\nYou agree that we may place holds on your funds or instruct a payment service provider to hold your funds, prior to disbursement. For the avoidance of doubt, if you receive funds to either a stored value account issued to you under Vaullti LLC’s Balance Terms and Conditions or to a payment account, a hold may also be placed on such funds. We will notify you by email and, depending on the reason, may request additional information from you to help resolve the issue. A hold may be placed if we have reason to believe there is an increased risk associated with the provision of our Payment Services or with a certain Managed Payments transaction; for example, if we cannot verify your identity or if your buyer files a dispute. We take into consideration relevant factors when assessing the risks, including selling history, seller performance, returns and cancellations, chargebacks, riskiness of the listing category, transaction value, the ability to make direct debits from your Linked Financial Account. We also may cancel or freeze the settlement of your proceeds as necessary to comply with our legal obligations in connection with fraud prevention, risk management, or regulatory compliance. Any hold placed on your funds will be lifted when the issue is resolved.\r\nWe may retain an amount that we reasonably believe may be necessary to pay for any refunds, reimbursements, or other payments associated with returns, Disputes, or other post-transaction activities, when your Vaullti LLC account is closed. Unless otherwise required by law, we will settle any unused retained amounts to your Linked Financial Account within 180 days of your Vaullti LLC account closure.\r\nYour bank’s holds and settlement procedures may at times cause delays in the settlement of funds to your Linked Financial Account, and we do not have control over these delays.\r\nRisk Mitigation\r\nIn order to manage risk or secure your obligations under these Payments Terms of Use, we have the right to hold a percentage of the proceeds prior to the job being completed. \r\nIf we have reason to believe there is an increased risk of non-fulfilment of your obligations under these Payments Terms of Use  we might take into consideration relevant risk factors for withholding payment. Including, as applicable (i) your Vaullti LLC account history, (iii) whether your Vaullti LLC account has an elevated number of customer claims or disputes, (iv) your business and/or personal credit history (business sellers may be subject to credit agency checks), and (vi) whether you have extended delivery time frames. \r\nOur Liability\r\nIf we have acted with reasonable precautions and/or in accordance with our legal obligations, we are not liable for any unauthorized, incorrectly, unexecuted, or delayed payment transactions when such issues were caused by abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control.\r\nSignature\r\nIn instances where we are required to collect your signature to meet anti-money laundering and/or other legal requirements, we may (where not prohibited by applicable law) treat your acceptance of these Payments Terms of Use as the equivalent of you providing us your signature.\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>26. Security; Third-Party Payment Services Providers; Data Protection\r\nSecurity\r\nYou acknowledge the importance of the security measures we put in place with regards to Managed Payments, and agree to comply with them. You are responsible for maintaining the security of all passwords, codes, or other login credentials used to access your Vaullti LLC account and the related Payment Services and, subject to Vaullti LLC’s seller protection policies, for any transactions made or actions taken using your Vaullti LLC account.\r\nIf you become aware of an unauthorized payment transaction or of a delayed or incorrectly executed transaction, you must notify us immediately by using a contact method stated in the “about” section of vaullti.  We may request written confirmation immediately following the notification; the notification shall be free of charge.\r\nThird-Party Payment Services Providers\r\nWe may use third-party payment services providers to assist us in providing Managed Payments (such as companies that process payments and disburse settlements, perform risk assessments or compliance checks, verify identity, or validate payment or settlement methods), and we may process your data and transfer it to these third parties. You hereby explicitly consent to: our use of such third-party service providers, the outsourcing of services to them, and the related transfer and processing of data. Where applicable so we can provide you with Managed Payments, you hereby waive any professional secrecy rights (third party companies have no visibility into production or goods). Regardless of whether we use third-party service providers, the appropriate Vaullti LLC Payment Entity remains responsible to you for the performance of the services contemplated under these Payments Terms of Use.\r\nData Protection [Applicable to Payment Services Provided by Vaullti LLC  , except ECA; For ECA’s Data Protection Terms, See Part V]\r\nOur performance of Payment Services entails the processing of your buyer’s personal data when a sale happens. With respect to such data processing, you, the Responsible Payment Entity, and the Payout Entity each act as a separate data controller/business under the applicable data protection laws (which may without limitation include, the General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other data protection laws to which you are subject). You agree to: comply with your obligations as a data controller/business pursuant to the applicable data protection laws, and provide us with all such reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance as necessary for us to meet our requirements as a data controller/business.\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>27. Collection of Fees and Other Amounts You Owe\r\nYou authorize us to collect from you any amounts you owe us or our Affiliates (in particular the Affiliate which provides the Vaullti LLC Services to you) under these Payments Terms of Use, the User Agreement, any other service contract, policy, agreement or as required by law (referred to as “Owed Amounts”). Owed Amounts typically include the following:\r\n•\tFees;\r\n•\tReturns, Refunds, Disputes, Fines, Penalties and Losses \r\n•\tAny amounts you owe exterior of Vaullti LLC\r\n•\tTaxes or other charges related to your use of our or our Affiliates’ services, if applicable and required by law; and\r\n•\tAmounts we incorrectly settled to you due to a payment processing error or otherwise (see Section 1 above).\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9 only provides the authorization for us to collect such amounts which you already owe us or our Affiliates and does not establish any independent claims against you.\r\nCollection of the Owed Amounts may be carried out on a one-time, sporadic, or recurring basis by the following means:\r\n•\tRetaining such amounts from your current or future disbursements relating to any transactions that you may have;\r\n•\tRecouping from your Linked Financial Account (and if required, by issuing a direct debit mandate or other similar authorization);\r\n•\tRecouping from any other payment instrument or payment method you may have authorized or placed on file with us or our Affiliates (for example, to pay for seller fees, shipping labels, or dispute resolution);\r\n•\tRecouping from your stored value account, if a stored value account has been issued to you;\r\n•\tRecouping from your payment account, if a payment account has been issued to you (see Part III); and\r\n•\tRetaining collections agencies or using other collections methods, if the collection by other means has been unsuccessful.\r\nYou authorize us to choose the method of collection among those listed above. We generally deduct Owed Amounts from your current or future disbursements we process on your behalf. If a stored value account or payment account has been issued to you, we will deduct the Owed Amounts from funds held in the relevant stored value account or payment account before disbursing the funds to you. If your disbursements awaiting payout or funds held are not sufficient to cover these amounts, we will charge your Linked Financial Account or another payment method on file. If you have several payment instruments on file, you may indicate a specific payment instrument as your preferred payment method for collecting Owed Amounts in your Vaullti LLC account.\r\nYou also authorize the Affiliate whom you have entered into the user agreement with for the provision of Vaullti LLC Services to charge you for any Owed Amounts on our behalf from any payment method you may have on file with such Affiliate.\r\nIf you provide us with a SEPA/BACS direct debit mandate for debiting Owed Amounts from your bank account, any required advance notice will be given to you at least three days prior to charging your bank account. At any point prior to you explicitly cancelling a SEPA/BACS direct debit mandate we have obtained from you, we may deduct Owed Amounts based on such mandate. You waive to the extent possible under applicable law, any rights you may have to receive advance notice of any particular preauthorized charge.\r\nIf our attempt to recoup an Owed Amount from a payment instrument you have authorized us to use fails as a result of your acts or omissions, we may charge you for the failed attempt as set forth on the Fee Page or as applicable in this document. \r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>28. Amendment\r\nWe may amend these Payments Terms of Use by notifying you of the changes in writing (for example, by posting a revised version of these Payments Terms of Use on our website. Before the anticipated effective date of such change, we will notify you at least fourteen (14) days prior or if your Payout entity is Vaullti LLC.\r\nIf you are a consumer (i.e., not a business) you will be deemed to have consented to these changes unless you explicitly reject them before the anticipated effective date. For all other sellers, your continued use of Managed Payments beyond the effective date of the changes will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\r\nTermination right in case of amendments (all sellers)\r\nIf you do not agree to proposed changes, you may terminate these Payments Terms of Use, pursuant to Section 11 (“Term, Termination”) below, without any extra cost at any time before their effective date. We always publish the amended Payments Terms of Use on the Vaullti LLC website.\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>29. Term, Termination\r\nThese Payments Terms of Use are effective indefinitely, unless terminated in accordance with the below.\r\nWe may terminate these Payments Terms of Use by giving written notice two months prior to your registered email address. However, we may also terminate these Payments Terms of Use on less notice or with immediate effect in the following scenarios:\r\n•\tWe are required to do so by law or a court order,\r\n•\tA governmental authority requires us to do so to comply with anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing obligations,\r\n•\tWe have reasonable grounds to believe you are carrying out a prohibited or illegal activity (including, but not limited to, financial crimes such as fraud, bribery, corruption money laundering, or sanctions violations),\r\n•\tWe are unable to verify your or your business’s identity, or any other information pertaining to you, or\r\n•\tYou are otherwise in breach of a material contractual obligation of these Payments Terms of Use, or seriously or persistently violating any provisions of these terms in any other way.\r\nIf Vaullti LLC is your Payout Entity, you may terminate these Payments Terms of Use and close your payment account, without prejudice to the termination events foreseen above, by giving one (1) month notice by notifying Vaullti LLC via email at customerservice@vaullti.com, explaining you wish to terminate. \r\nIf Vaullti LLC is not your Payout Entity, you may terminate these Payments Terms of Use by closing your Vaullti LLC account; if you use Managed Payments after such termination, you will be deemed to have again accepted these Payments Terms of Use.\r\nIf you give notice of termination to one Vaullti LLC Payment Entity, such notice shall also be deemed as a termination notice to the remaining Vaullti LLC  .\r\nOnce you have registered for Managed Payments on Vaullti LLC and your Vaullti LLC account has been activated, the use of Managed Payments effectively becomes a condition to using your Vaullti LLC account. Should you therefore terminate this agreement, you will not be able to reset your Vaullti LLC account to the state before you registered for Managed Payments. Our Affiliates which provide you the Vaullti LLC Services according to the User Agreement may terminate the User Agreement pursuant to the termination provisions therein.\r\nTermination of this Agreement shall not affect the rights or liabilities of either party accrued until termination and/or any terms intended (expressly or implicitly) to survive termination, including your obligation to pay amounts owed to us relating to your activities prior to termination and our right to collect from you such amounts in accordance with these Payments Terms of Use. If there are pending payment transactions at the time the termination takes effect, they will be processed pursuant to terms of these Payments Terms of Use unless prohibited by law. As of the effective date of the termination, you will not be able to sell any items on Vaullti LLC Services anymore.\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>30. Assignment\r\nIn our sole discretion, we may assign our rights and obligations under these Payments Terms of Use and, in such event, we will notify you accordingly.\r\nSELLING FEES\r\nEvery month you get up to 20 free job listings at a 1 week period, with 4 tag words.  Or 250 free job listings at a 1 week period with 10 tag words - if you have V-PRO (Vaullti Professional) \r\nAfter you've used your free job listings, the prices are as follows;\r\n•\t$4.99 - Job listing for two weeks. Autorenew can be setup, charges will apply.  \r\n•\t$1.99 - per listing per tag word (up to 10 allowed). Multiple tag words are 1.99 each.\r\nJob Open \r\nWhen a job is created an object is selected from a vaullt and sent to the marketplace. Vaullti will execute fingerprinting and determine if the object is protected property. If the job listing is free, no charges will be applied. If not, the cost will applied at the time of posting. \r\nBid Open \r\nWhen the job officially posts to the marketplace it is now a bid. It is present on the marketplace for two weeks, or longer, pending autorenew.   Companies and individuals post responses to the bid until time is exhausted and a winner is selected. Once the winner is selected the job creator has 24 hours to use “myworkshop” and start job closeout. \r\nJob Closeout \r\nWhen the winning bid is selected the original job creator elects to produce the job with the winning bidder. Cancelling now will result in fees relative to the total cost as well as user rating penalties. Cancellation fees are 5% of the total job cost not to exceed $200. Upon selecting, the file is sent and the bid winner has 24 hours to begin production. Upon completing the production, the bid winner will log all shipping and document package shipment and provide tracking.\r\nBid Closeout\r\nThe job creator will receive notifications that the package(s) are in shipment and when they are expected to be received. Upon package receiving they will check for visible damage during shipping and report immediately. They will then immediately review the contents of the packages as they have 36 from the moment of delivery to report any damages or errors. If the delivery of goods is as ordered, they will go to “myworkshop” and rate the bidder and the transaction, and finalize and close the bid. Vaullti LLC charges a flat fee of 15% per job valued at less than $5,000, 12.5% per job valued at $5,001-15,000. And 8% at all jobs over $15,001. \r\nTotal costs that are expected to be included in the winning bid are shipping and handling and taxes, and any additional services the job creator elects to pay for. If shipping internationally, it is the bidder’s responsibility to calculate shipping and handling and subsequent tariffs and taxes. \r\n\r\nIf a bid is placed and cannot be produced for the value originally quoted, the winning bidder will be subject to financial penalties and rating reductions. The financial penalties assessed will be the amount needed to fully cover the next closest bidders bid.  \r\n\r\nBuying or selling outside of Vaullti LLC\r\nIf you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of vaullti llc, you'll be charged a fee (%14) based on the total amount of the sale even if your item doesn't sell. In this situation, the total amount of the sale is determined as follows:\r\n•\tThe total price identified between the buyer and seller, or the original listing price, whichever is higher.\r\nAdditional fees\r\nIf you are found responsible for a disputed amount, such as not manufacturing at the desired quality, we charge a $40.00 dispute fee, excluding sales tax, for each dispute to address labor. \r\n\r\nCurrencies other than USD\r\n\r\nCurrency conversion charge applied and retained by Vaullti LLC is 4%. \r\n\r\nREFUNDS AND RETURNS\r\nIf a customer has a problem with their order, or if they change their mind about a purchase, they’ll get in touch with you and ask for help. Once the buyer tells you there’s a problem, you have 24 hours to respond, and 36 hours to get resolution. \r\nIf an item went missing and never arrived, you'll either need to provide additional tracking details from one of the shipping carriers integrated with Vaullti LLC, or offer a refund. If the buyer got their item but it’s faulty, damaged, or doesn't match the listing description, depending on the value of the order, you need to work with them to resolve their issue (you also have to cover the return shipping costs) or speak with insurance of the shipping company. \r\n\r\nIf the job went to bid, and the job poster cancels, the job poster will incur fees. Tips to avoid bad job creators:\r\n1.\tRead ratings and reviews of poster\r\n2.\tDoes it seem unrealistic this company the company has the resources for the job?\r\n3.\tDo they have multiple cancelled jobs in the near past?\r\n\r\nWhat to do if a buyer has an issue\r\nHelp a buyer with an item that hasn’t arrived\r\nIf a buyer doesn’t receive their item, they’re entitled to a refund unless you can provide tracking information from one of the shipping carriers integrated with Vaullti LLC showing it was delivered by the estimated delivery date. (pending size of job – large jobs will require more logistical proof)\r\n\r\nReturns\r\nIf the buyer wants to return an item to you, your options for responding depend on why they want to send it back. If the item is damaged, faulty, or doesn’t match the listing description, you’ll have to refund them or replace the item even if you don’t offer returns. If they’ve changed their mind, your options depend on your return policy.\r\n\r\nReturn shipping\r\nIf you accept a return from the buyer, they need to send the item back to you before you issue a refund. If the buyer is sending an item back because it doesn’t match the listing description or it arrived damaged or faulty, you’re responsible for the cost of return shipping, even if you don’t offer returns. If they simply changed their mind or ordered the wrong item, who pays for return shipping is determined by your return policy.\r\nOffer a refund\r\nSellers can offer buyers full or partial refunds up to 90 days after the original transaction date. If there's an open cancellation request, return, or an open dispute made outside of Vaullti LLC against an order, then the Send refund option will not be available. \r\n\r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>31. Unable to resolve the buyer’s issue? Ask Vaullti LLC to step in\r\nAsk Vaullti LLC to step in\r\nIf you and the buyer haven’t been able to come to an agreement after 3 business days, you can ask us to step in and resolve the issue. We’ll assess all the information and come to a decision. It’s important to remember that if you ask us to step in and we close the case in the buyer’s favor, you could receive a defect (which might affect your seller standards), so you should only ask us for help when you’ve exhausted all other options. \r\nAppeal Vaullti LLC’s decision on a case\r\nIf you disagree with our decision after we’ve been asked to step in, you can ask us to take another look for up to 30 days after the claim has been closed. In order to request an appeal, you must provide additional details for us to take into consideration, such as photographs showing there’s nothing wrong with the item. We’ll review your new information and get back to you with our final decision, usually within 48 hours.

Automating your return process can not only save you time but also provide a great experience for your customers.\r\nAvoid disputes with buyers\r\nBe transparent and follow general tips for packing and shipping items, and advice for communicating with buyers.\r\nORDER CANCELLATION\r\nWe understand that there may be times when orders need to be canceled. Buyers can request a cancellation, but generally only sellers can cancel an order. \r\nWhen a seller can cancel an order\r\nA seller can cancel an order if:\r\n•\tThe buyer asks to cancel the order and they haven't started production or downloaded the object\r\n•\tThe buyer hasn't paid within the time allowed\r\nSellers won't be able to cancel an order if the buyer has reported that the item hasn't arrived, or has opened a return request.\r\nRefunds\r\nIf the buyer completed payment through Vaullti LLC checkout and the seller cancels the order, a full refund will be issued to the buyer's original payment method.\r\nIf payment was not completed through Vaullti LLC checkout and the seller cancels the order (for example, the buyer paid by invoice), the seller will be responsible for issuing a full refund to the buyer.\r\nAbusing the order cancellation process\r\nSellers aren't allowed to abuse the order cancellation process. A seller should never cancel an order and select an incorrect cancellation reason, including falsely claiming that the buyer failed to pay. There are fees associated with canceling after a job is out to bid. \r\n\r\nActivity that doesn't follow Vaullti LLC policy could result in a range of actions including canceling listings, hiding or demoting all listings from search results, blocking some or all of your messages/communication with other members, lowering seller rating, buying or selling restrictions, account suspension, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. All fees paid or payable in relation to listings or accounts on which we take any action will not be refunded or otherwise credited to your account.\r\nOther terms and related policies\r\n•\tOnce an order has been canceled, it can't be undone\r\n•\tTo have the cancelled bid re-set in the marketplace new billing will incur\r\n•\tBuying an item or bidding on an auction on Vaullti LLC is a commitment to complete a purchase. Buyers should pay for items within 2 calendar days or the seller can choose to pause production of the order. If buyers have excessive canceled orders for unpaid items, they may be subject to the consequences outlined in our Unpaid item policy and Abusive buyer policy\r\n•\tA buyer cannot leave feedback on a canceled transaction. Learn more in our Unpaid item policy\r\n•\tCanceling an order because the item is out of stock will result in fees and rating penalties, as sellers are responsible for fulfilling the items they've won bids and jobs on. \r\n•\tIf the buyer has paid and the seller declines or doesn't respond to the buyer's request to cancel, the seller will incur penalties and rating reductions. Vaullti will hold payment until progress is shown. \r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>32.  Seller levels\r\nWe assess your seller performance on the 1st of each month. Based on your sales history and the quality of service you provide to your buyers, you'll be assigned one of the following seller levels:\r\n•\tHigh: You're one of the best sellers on eBay, providing an exceptional quality of customer service as well as meeting minimum sales requirements \r\n•\tMiddle: You're meeting our minimum standard for sellers and looking after your customers well\r\n•\tLow: You're not meeting one or more of our minimum requirements for customer service quality\r\n\r\nTo achieve High, you'll need to:\r\n•\tHave an account that's been active for at least 90 days\r\n•\tHave at least 24 transactions and $30,000 in sales with buyers over the past 12 months\r\n•\tMeet set goals in the bid for transaction defect rate, delivery date, and additional services.\r\n\r\nIf you've met these standards, we'll automatically upgrade your status at your next evaluation.\r\nHigh benefits \r\n you qualify for these exclusive benefits:\r\n•\tVaullti marking showing trust will be displayed prominently in search results and in the listing description\r\n•\tV-Pro order history analytics\r\n\r\nIf we're asked to step in and help, you can resolve the issue with the buyer by issuing a refund or accepting a return so the request isn't concluded as the seller's fault. If the seller is found to be responsible for the issue, this will result in an at fault scenario and it will be noted in your user rating, affecting it negatively. \r\nThings to do to positively impact user ratings\r\n•\tDescribe your offerings accurately (buyer and seller sides). Use pictures and include specifics in your listing so everyone knows what to expect.\r\n•\tUse tracking when possible and provide updates. \r\n•\tBe as transparent as possible.\r\n•\tRespond promptly and provide clear answers or responses.\r\n•\tProvide clear return and payment policies in your listing\r\n•\t\r\nLate shipments\r\nit's important to make sure you send your items on time. Late shipment rates are determined by the percentage of transactions that you sent after the handling time stated in your listing or that were not delivered by the estimated delivery date.\r\nWe'll only consider a shipment late if:\r\n•\tTracking shows the item was delivered after the estimated delivery date, unless there's an acceptance scan within your dispatch time or there's confirmation from the buyer of on-time delivery\r\n•\tThe buyer confirms the item was delivered after the estimated delivery date, unless there's an acceptance scan within your handling time or there's delivery confirmation by the estimated delivery date\r\n\r\n\r\nYour seller level can fall to Low if your rating is above 2% \r\nBuyers and sellers can see your rating. \r\nThe consequences of falling Below Standard can include:\r\n•\tYour items may be placed lower in search results.\r\n•\tWe may limit or restrict you from selling on your account and related accounts, or from registering a new account.\r\n•\tFunds from your sales may be distributed at a rate matching the production timeline.\r\n•\tYou will be charged at a higher rate to use the Promoted Listings tool.\r\n•\tYou will be charged at a higher rate to create new campaigns or edit existing campaigns.\r\n•\tWe may downgrade your account if your rating falls below 2 stars (Low) for more than 60 days.\r\nUsually, we will only apply permanent selling restrictions when your account has been evaluated as Low for at least 3 consecutive months. However, we may take action at any time if we have urgent concerns about your account. \r\nIf we detect fraud or if your selling practices pose a threat to the buyer experience the actions we take will be proportional to the nature of the issue we have identified and what is reasonably required to protect the interests of vaullti and it’s users. \r\nIf we apply any limits or restrictions on your account, we'll send you an email to let you know and methods to remedy. \r\n\r\nDetailed ratings\r\nFor additional insight into performance, you can view your detailed ratings. This is a breakdown of how you've been rated:\r\n•\t How accurately was the item described?\r\n•\t Did you communicate well with your buyer?\r\n•\t How quickly did you send the item?\r\n•\t Were the costs reasonable?\r\n\r\nThese work into your rating. We use a 10 star system, 1 is the lowest and 10 is the best. \r\n</a>\r\n<br></br>\r\n            <a>33.
