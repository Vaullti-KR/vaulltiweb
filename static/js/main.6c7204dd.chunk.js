Disputes A buyer (or the owner of a payment instrument) may initiate a chargeback, direct debit reversal, or otherwise asks their financial institution to open a payment dispute (all referred to solely within this Part I as \u201cDispute\u201d) in connection with a transaction. The final outcome of the Dispute will be decided by the buyer\u2019s financial institution. We will manage Disputes, as follows: When a Dispute is opened, we will notify you and ask you whether you choose to accept or challenge the Dispute. If you accept the Dispute, you agree to the reversal of the payment to the buyer. If you challenge the Dispute, Vaullti LLC will submit to the financial institution any relevant evidence you provide about the Dispute. You agree to provide timely information to assist in the Dispute resolution process and understand that your failure to provide requested information on the timeline we require and as specified by credit and debit card networks' and other payment service providers' rules could adversely impact the outcome of a Dispute investigation, up to complete forfeiture of the amounts in Dispute. If you accept the Dispute or if the buyer\u2019s financial institution decides in favor of the buyer, the respective amount will be refunded to the buyer's original payment method and charged to us. You must reimburse us for such charges, unless you are eligible for protections in which case you are not held liable for amounts refunded to the buyer. If you choose to accept the Dispute, we may still decide to challenge the Dispute in our discretion and at no additional costs to you. Some payment institutions offer an optional arbitration process to contest the results of an individual Dispute. We may ask for your consent to participate in such arbitration process. If you consent to chargeback arbitration, you authorize us to represent and defend you throughout the arbitration. You will be responsible for all costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and any arbitration fees assessed by third parties, arising from such arbitration proceedings), as agreed between you and us in each case, and you authorize us to pay these amounts on your behalf while the arbitration is pending. You will not contest the resolution of any Dispute that we investigate and/or re-present, nor will you re-open resolved Dispute investigations. Fines, Penalties and Losses At this time we are unable to manage payments for prohibited items.  Before listing your item, you must ensure it complies with Vaullti LLC\u2019s rules, applicable laws, and any additional restrictions imposed by credit card associations, network rules, or third-party payments service providers that we may use. You agree to indemnify and reimburse us for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, costs, losses, damages, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses incurred by us or brought against us by a third party arising out of (a) your breach of these Payments Terms of Use or the User Agreement including without limitation any violation of Vaullti LLC\u2019s policies; (b) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or (c) any transaction processed by us for you for an item or service you listed on Vaullti LLC (including without limitation the accuracy of your item description or any claim or dispute arising out of items or services offered or sold by you). Holds We reserve the right to manage the risks associated with providing you the Payment Services, by placing restrictions on your access to your funds when deemed necessary, as described in further detail below. You agree that we may place holds on your funds or instruct a payment service provider to hold your funds, prior to disbursement. For the avoidance of doubt, if you receive funds to either a stored value account issued to you under Vaullti LLC\u2019s Balance Terms and Conditions or to a payment account, a hold may also be placed on such funds. We will notify you by email and, depending on the reason, may request additional information from you to help resolve the issue. A hold may be placed if we have reason to believe there is an increased risk associated with the provision of our Payment Services or with a certain Managed Payments transaction; for example, if we cannot verify your identity or if your buyer files a dispute. We take into consideration relevant factors when assessing the risks, including selling history, seller performance, returns and cancellations, chargebacks, riskiness of the listing category, transaction value, the ability to make direct debits from your Linked Financial Account. We also may cancel or freeze the settlement of your proceeds as necessary to comply with our legal obligations in connection with fraud prevention, risk management, or regulatory compliance. Any hold placed on your funds will be lifted when the issue is resolved. We may retain an amount that we reasonably believe may be necessary to pay for any refunds, reimbursements, or other payments associated with returns, Disputes, or other post-transaction activities, when your Vaullti LLC account is closed. Unless otherwise required by law, we will settle any unused retained amounts to your Linked Financial Account within 180 days of your Vaullti LLC account closure.

If the job listing is free, no charges will be applied. If not, the cost will applied at the time of posting. Bid Open When the job officially posts to the marketplace it is now a bid. It is present on the marketplace for two weeks, or longer, pending autorenew.   Companies and individuals post responses to the bid until time is exhausted and a winner is selected. Once the winner is selected the job creator has 24 hours to use \u201cmyworkshop\u201d and start job closeout. Job Closeout When the winning bid is selected the original job creator elects to produce the job with the winning bidder. Cancelling now will result in fees relative to the total cost as well as user rating penalties. Cancellation fees are 5% of the total job cost not to exceed $200. Upon selecting, the file is sent and the bid winner has 24 hours to begin production.

Bid Closeout The job creator will receive notifications that the package(s) are in shipment and when they are expected to be received. Upon package receiving they will check for visible damage during shipping and report immediately. They will then immediately review the contents of the packages as they have 36 from the moment of delivery to report any damages or errors.

Total costs that are expected to be included in the winning bid are shipping and handling and taxes, and any additional services the job creator elects to pay for. If shipping internationally, it is the bidder\u2019s responsibility to calculate shipping and handling and subsequent tariffs and taxes. If a bid is placed and cannot be produced for the value originally quoted, the winning bidder will be subject to financial penalties and rating reductions. The financial penalties assessed will be the amount needed to fully cover the next closest bidders bid. Buying or selling outside of Vaullti LLC If you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of vaullti llc, you'll be charged a fee (%14) based on the total amount of the sale even if your item doesn't sell.

If the buyer got their item but it\u2019s faulty, damaged, or doesn't match the listing description, depending on the value of the order, you need to work with them to resolve their issue (you also have to cover the return shipping costs) or speak with insurance of the shipping company.

If they simply changed their mind or ordered the wrong item, who pays for return shipping is determined by your return policy.

ORDER CANCELLATION We understand that there may be times when orders need to be canceled. Buyers can request a cancellation, but generally only sellers can cancel an order.

Refunds If the buyer completed payment through Vaullti LLC checkout and the seller cancels the order, a full refund will be issued to the buyer's original payment method. If payment was not completed through Vaullti LLC checkout and the seller cancels the order (for example, the buyer paid by invoice), the seller will be responsible for issuing a full refund to the buyer. Abusing the order cancellation process Sellers aren't allowed to abuse the order cancellation process. A seller should never cancel an order and select an incorrect cancellation reason, including falsely claiming that the buyer failed to pay. There are fees associated with canceling after a job is out to bid. Activity that doesn't follow Vaullti LLC policy could result in a range of actions including canceling listings, hiding or demoting all listings from search results, blocking some or all of your messages/communication with other members, lowering seller rating, buying or selling restrictions, account suspension, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. All fees paid or payable in relation to listings or accounts on which we take any action will not be refunded or otherwise credited to your account.
